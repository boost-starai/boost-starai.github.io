[Human Allied AI-Part1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nY2UuBrt4QQ&list=PLJPXEH0boeNDWTNwWTWnVffXi5XwAj1mb&index=10&t=7s&app=desktop),[Human Allied AI-Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eR0mPNZAJlY&list=PLJPXEH0boeNDWTNwWTWnVffXi5XwAj1mb&index=12)

It is a 2 1/2 hour tutorial on Human Allied Statistical Relational AI starting with learning from data, to including human inputs as initial bias to finally closing the loop with seeking human inputs (richer than labels). It covers a broad spectrum of work done in the Starling lab and you can get an overview of our lab''s work from these video lectures. You can also take a look at the other video lectures from this workshop here. [Video Lectures at ACAI 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJPXEH0boeNDWTNwWTWnVffXi5XwAj1mb)
