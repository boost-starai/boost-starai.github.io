## 1. Adverse Drug-Events

### People Involved:

* Devendra Dhami
* Mayukh Das


### About:
Bioinformatics is the field of applying statistics and computer science to the field of molecular biology. Our lab focuses mainly on the subarea of pattern recognition in biomedical data.

Biomedical data is composed of data in many formats: electronic health records are inherently relational, while the results of clinical tests tend to be propositional. The data can have multiple views&mdash;imagining data, clinical data, genomic data, or text from medical literature&mdash;which may all describe the same concept from different perspectives.

Learning from such disparate sources of information is a challenging task. We develop methods which can deal with such data separately, either as standalone datasets or combined in such a way that multiple types of data are used for prediction in a single model.

### Sample Publications:

2. Devendra Singh Dhami, Ameet Soni, David Page, Sriraam Natarajan, *Identifying Parkinson's Patients : A Functional Gradient Boosting Approach*, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME) (2017).

## 3. Automatic Operation Notes

### People Involved:

* Michael Skinner
* Alexander L. Hayes

### About:

With the explosion in the volume of medical information, there is the promise that patient care can be managed more precisely based on automatic extraction and evaluation of patients' medical information available in the electronic health record (EHR).

One challenge is the limited ability to evaluate the rich information present in free text format, such as in notes written by health care providers.  We are starting to remedy this problem by examining a large set of operative notes describing a common surgical procedure, aiming to elicit a context free grammar that might be used to automatically generate such notes.

Research in this direction may help reduce the time doctors spend on such tasks, giving them more time to focus on their patients.
