## 1. Adverse Drug-Events

### People Involved:

* Devendra Singh Dhami
* Mayukh Das


### About:
With the increase in the number of drug discoveries and thus the data associated with each drug, detecting when these new drugs (and the old drugs) with react to something (can be other drugs, food etc.) adversely has become a very important problem inside bioinformatics. This problem of adverse drug events (ADE) is now being studied in the field of machine learning as due to the large amount of data available, it will be simpler for the machines to detect hidden patterns that might result in these ADEs.

Our previous work in this area was specifically in natural language processing (NLP) where we looked at PubMed articles and extracted relational features and constucted a model on these features. The model was supplemented by expert advice that was employed to identify text patterns in articles that might suggest the presence of an ADE(s). Recently we have focused on the problem of drug-drug interactions by looking at the molecular structure of the drugs and the interaction pathways associated with each drug. The goal is to create an adverse drug events network that can be easily minde in the future for detecting and discovering any ADEs.

## People Involved

* Mayukh Das

Bioinformatics is the field of applying statistics and computer science to the field of molecular biology. Our lab focuses mainly on the subarea of pattern recognition in biomedical data.

Biomedical data is composed of data in many formats: electronic health records are inherently relational, while the results of clinical tests tend to be propositional. The data can have multiple views&mdash;imagining data, clinical data, genomic data, or text from medical literature&mdash;which may all describe the same concept from different perspectives.

Learning from such disparate sources of information is a challenging task. We develop methods which can deal with such data separately, either as standalone datasets or combined in such a way that multiple types of data are used for prediction in a single model.
