## 1. Communicating with Computers
### People Involved:
* Mayukh Das

### About:
The vision of this project (under the DARPA CwC grant) is to build smart machines that enable *"Artificial Intelligence"* agents and humans to interact seamlessly, make decisions and solve problems together and learn from each other as well as complement each others capabilities. An over-arching framework for human-machine collaboration involving multiple human (non)experts and machines through varied modalities and protocols of interaction. Concept learning/teaching, collaborative planning, domain transfer/extension and higher level knowledge induction are some of the avenues that we are presently investigating.

## 2. Knowledge-based Learning
### People Involved:
* Phillip Odom
* Shuo Yang
* Mayukh Das


### About:
Knowledge-rich approaches to  learning  and sequential decision-making try to alleviate the limitations of data-driven techniques caused by noise, stochasticity and asymmetry of knowledge. They leverage rich knowledge assimilated by domain experts through years of experience to learn better models. Recent years have witnessed a major research thrust in this direction and our group is an active contributor to this cause; focused on building knowledge-augmented learning frameworks for representation and elicitation of knowledge from, potentially multiple, expert(s) for optimal learning both structure and parameters of compact models from noisy structured data both in context of prediction/regression tasks as well as sequential decision-making (RL, planning, Imitation Learning etc.). Specifically, we address 'asymmetry of knowledge' where an AI agent may have access to certain resources and vast computational power but may lack the necessary knowledge to prioritize choices. Human experts understand such priorities implicitly and we leverage that to generate better models.

Our research includes, but is not limited to, knowledge-augmented Statistical Relational Learning, human guided decision-making (esp. in stochastic, partially observable, semi-structured environments), various modalities of human guidance and knowledge elicitation and, finally, successful application of such systems to real-world tasks such as health, biomedicine and finance. Recently we have also been focusing on knowledge-guided deep models to alleviate one of the major bottlenecks of deep learning (sub-optimal learning in presence of sparse/noisy data).

## 3. Closing the loop
### People Involved:
* Phillip Odom
* Mayukh Das
* Alexander Hayes

### About:
The crux of human-allied smart machines lie in their capability to communicate back to the human, be it for sharing knowledge, for querying additional guidance/knowledge or just for mere inconsequential conversation. 

We develop AI agents that are able to infer dearth of knowledge in specific parts of a task *(knowing-what-it-knows)*, communicate and explain to human (non-)expert(s) through various modalities, such as text, visuals, gestures etc., and actively seek advice/preference/guidance accordingly *(knowing-when-to-ask)*. Queries and explanations from to the agent to the human are hierarchical and are at varying levels of generality, making it extremely intuitive and easy for the human ally to effectively help the agent make better choices and learn better models. We build such frameworks both for predictive modeling and sequential decision making.

The grand vision of smart machines is enabling AI agents and humans to interact seamlessly, make decisions and solve problems together and learn from as well as complement each others capabilities. We share such a vision and we build frameworks and techniques to leverage human knowledge in creating smarter sequential decision-making and predictive systems and protocols for such knowledge elicitation.

Our research includes, but is not limited to, knowledge-augmented Statistical Relational Learning, human guided and collaborative decision-making and planning (esp. in stochastic, partially observable, semi-structured environments), "active" human-AI interaction, various modalities of human guidance and, finally, successful application of such systems to real-world tasks such as Health, Biomedicine and Finance.

Concept learning, domain transfer/extension and higher level knowledge induction are some additional interesting research ventures (motivated by DARPA 'Communicating with Computers'). We aim for an over-arching framework for human-AI collaboration involving multiple human (non)experts and machines with varied modalities of interaction.
