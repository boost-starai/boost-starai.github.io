### About:
We develop methods for fast approximate counting for Statistical Relational AI.
In the age of 'Big Data', *scalability* is one of the key challenges both for learning and (lifted) inference in the context of Statistical Relational models. A major bottleneck towards scalable SRL is **counting** - computing the number of satisfied instances of complex features (# satisfied groundings of First-Order Logic formulas). Counting is a key operation in SRL be it for computing the coverage in structure search, likelihood estimation in parameter learning, or for computing cluster size in lifted inference. Counting is hard, specifically *#P-complete*, which poses increasingly greater challenges with large scale databases. However, exact computation of  counts are inconsequential in context of large/dense data sets. *(Example: There will not be any significant change in the popularity of a professor based on whether the papers (s)he has published has 400 or 419 citations)*
Thus, we develop performance-preserving **approximation strategies** for such counts, paving the way for scalable and efficient SRL.
