### Basic File Structure

Files that **BoostSRL** operates on are stored in a folder with three things:

1. `background.txt` : Modes
2. `train/` folder :
  * `train_bk.txt` : Pointer to the background file.
  * `train_facts.txt` : Facts
  * `train_pos.txt` : Positive examples
  * `train_neg.txt` : Negative examples
3. `test/` folder :
  * `test_bk.txt` : Pointer to the background file.
  * `test_facts.txt` : Facts
  * `test_pos.txt` : Positive examples
  * `test_neg.txt` : Negative examples

Example:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boost-starai/BoostSRL-Misc/master/Images/basicFileStructure.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; padding-top: 0.4em; padding-bottom: 0.4em;">

*File structure for the [Cora dataset](/datasets/cora/), notice that the background is called "cora_bk.txt" in this example.*

This is okay if `train_bk.txt` and `test_bk.txt` both point correctly with: `import: "../cora_bk.txt".`

### FAQ

* *What does it mean to have positive and negative examples during testing? Isn't the point of testing that I do not know these labels ahead of time?*

Think from a classic machine learning perspective. We divide data into training and test sets, learn from training set, hide the labels on the test set, and try to predict what is hidden. Positive and negative examples during testing are hidden, and the goal is to predict which are positive and which are negative based on the learned model and the facts.

If you want to use the model to perform inference on data you do not know the labels for, add your data to either `test_pos.txt` or `test_neg.txt`. The regression values in the `results_(target).txt` can be roughly interpreted as "What is the probability of this example being true/false?", respectfully.

### Advanced File Structure

After training/testing, more files and folders will appear. This advanced guide explains what each of them are, including the contents of the `models`, `dotFiles`, `bRDNs`, and `WILLtheories` directories.

Not all of these will necessarily appear, for example: the `CombinedTrees(target).dot` only appears when the `-combine` flag is set.

<!-- Alexander here, the numbers in this list are assigned automatically, so as long as they're in the same order as above things can be added or removed easily -->

1. `Data/`: Directory that contains the data we train/test on.
2. `background.txt`: [modes file](../basic-modes/) used to guide the search space.
3. `BoostSRL.jar`: If you're using a jar file, you'll usually keep it at the root of the data directory.
4. `test/`: Directory containing testing data.
5. `query_(target).db`:
24601. `results_(target).db`: Results of running inference (testing) on the data.
7. `test_bk.txt`: Pointer to the `background.txt`
8. `test_facts.txt`: Predicates described in the `background.txt`

18. `WILLTreeFor_(target)0.dot`: First of the boosted trees.
19. `...`: For each tree, there will be an associated file named `WILLTreeFor_(target)#.dot`
20. `WILLTreeFor_(target)9.dot`: Last of the boosted trees, equal to one less than the number of trees learned.
